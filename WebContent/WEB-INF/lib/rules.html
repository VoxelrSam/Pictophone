		<h1>How do I play Pictophone?</h1>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		
		<div style="width:500px;margin:auto;text-align:left;">
			<p>
				This game is much like "Telephone" where you whisper a message along a group of friends and see how the message has transformed in the end. 
				The catch with this, though, is that instead of whispering, users must draw the message to the best of their abilities.
				<br/>
				<br/>
				
				In essence, there are 3 main stages to the game:
			</p>
			
			<div style="width:350px;margin:auto;">
				<ol>
					<li>
						The first user writes a prompt that will be the initial "message."
					</li>
					<li>
						The next user then tries to draw the message given to them to the best of their abilities.
					</li>
					<li>
						The user after that then attempts to guess what the message was based off of the drawing the last user came up with.
					</li>
				</ol>
			</div>
			
			<p>
				The cycle then repeats through stages 2 and 3 until all of the users have contributed something to the game.
				In the end, all of the users are then shown the timeline of how the events unfolded.
				Most of the time, the message will transform into something quite different than what it started out as!
